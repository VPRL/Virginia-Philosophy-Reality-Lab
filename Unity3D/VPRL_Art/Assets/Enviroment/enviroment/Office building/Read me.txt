Thanks for buying the polygon office building.


Light baking :
- Set all to static expect moving objects, door & elevator or any you want to move.
- To get good performance and it is really required that you light baking all. It takes a while and depends on you computer performance and 
   which quality you want to get at the end.




Performance :

- occlusion culling you scene which really saves you much performance.





Building :

The doors & elevator are already programmed.
To fix the elevator flip, you need to programm a fix by you self. If you stand with you Player in it  -> Transform the height equal as the evelator current moves.
If you jump, turn the holding off until you grounding with you player.






Setting up the Player:

- Import the standard assets from unity and drag the FPS controller into the scene of the office building <- Or use you player and involve the script "DoorAction" in it.
- drag the " Action cube Prefab " into the camera of the FPS controller, so that the "Action cube Prefab" aim forward(The blue arrow) <- you can also only using the script, clear it with you self, how you use it.
- Also tag you player as "Player"


"e" is the button to performance a action to open the door or to click a button in the elvator
