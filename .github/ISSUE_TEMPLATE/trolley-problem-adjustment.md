**Describe the Adjustment**
A clear and concise description of what it is we should adjust.

**Things to Consider**
Guideline of information needed:
1. Where are you in the experience? (Just loaded up, was in the office, was at the control booth, etc)
2. What object/item specifically are we thinking of adjusting? (Handle on the deck, button at the office, barrel at the tower)
3. Is this a time based adjustment? (Between the first and second train we need 5 extra seconds)
4. Is this a bug? (I get stuck between training and the first train) Please fill out the bug template instead, that can be found [at the bug template](https://github.com/vmasc-odu/Virginia-Philosophy-Reality-Lab/issues/new?assignees=JShull&labels=bug&template=bug---crash-report.md&title=) :grey_exclamation:

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the adjustment please include as much additional information as you'd like.
