## What is the Virginia Philosophy Reality Lab?
The Virginia Philosophy Reality Lab is an interdisciplinary coalition of educators and researchers at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, that explores philosophical issues through extended reality (XR) technologies.  We are currently developing virtual reality modules on the basis of philosophical thought experiments to be used as educational tools in the classroom and research tools for experimental studies.   

## How can I get involved?
We are constantly looking for individuals to participate in our studies.  If you are interested in participating in our next study, please contact us at vprealitylab@gmail.com
If you are an educator or researcher interested in using VR in the classroom or on your next project, all of our completed modules are available on our GitHub page for download.

## Additional Resources
We are part of a growing network of thinkers and researchers around the world interested in using XR to pursue traditional philosophical topics.  Click HERE to explore other resources and papers exploring these issues.
