## What is the Virginia Philosophy Reality Lab?
The Virginia Philosophy Reality Lab is an interdisciplinary coalition of educators and researchers at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) in Norfolk, Virginia, that explores philosophical issues through extended reality (XR) technologies.  We are currently developing virtual reality modules on the basis of philosophical thought experiments to be used as educational tools in the classroom and research tools for experimental studies.   

The Virginia Philosophy Reality Lab began is a partnership between the ODU [Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies](https://www.odu.edu/philosophy) and the [Virginia Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation Center](https://www.odu.edu/vmasc).  It also works with students and faculty in the ODU [Game Studies & Design Program](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/game-studies-design) to create compelling XR experiences that explore philosophical ideas, such as the ethics of life and death decisions in real and virtual contexts.

If you are an educator or researcher interested in using VR in the classroom or on your next project, all of our completed modules are available on our GitHub page for download.
